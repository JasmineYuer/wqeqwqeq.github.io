# My personal Summary 
- **Resume** can get access [here](/stanley_resume.pdf)
- Chinese Resume [here](/中文简历.pdf)

I am a 2020 M.S. Business Analytic Candidate at College of William & Mary. I am proficient at Python, R and SQL. My experience at ETL, machine learning, deep learning, optimization and cloud computing can extract insightful business value with data in gigabytes

My summer internship at Global AI.(a startup in New York) built imputation pipeline and data warehouse dealing with data in gigabytes,
deployed dashboard, machine learning models on HerokU and AWS EC2, and scraped large dataset from various source automatically in parallel. 

My capstone for verizon built a predictive model to accurately forcast the population growth and then designed a optimization model to select cell tower location. Our combined model approximately saved over 5 millions budget. 

# Why Do I create this site 

This site is meant to showcase some of my completed/on-going projects. Additionally, the idea of this site is to not only show the work I have done, but to also present my progression over time, and the evolution of the completeness of the projects as I learn more in the field. Please send me feedback if you think something could be improved! Thank you!
